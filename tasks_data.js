    text: `Natural disasters are serious events that can cause a lot of damage and suffering. There are different types of natural disasters. One common type is earthquakes. They happen when the ground shakes, and they can destroy buildings and roads. Another type is floods, which occur when there is too much rain, and water covers land. Hurricanes are strong storms with heavy winds and rain. They can cause a lot of destruction in coastal areas. Wildfires are also dangerous; they can spread quickly in dry areas and burn forests and homes. Lastly, there are tornadoes, which are very strong winds that can destroy everything in their path.  Natural disasters remind us to respect nature and its power. It is important to be prepared for these events and to have a plan to stay safe.`,
